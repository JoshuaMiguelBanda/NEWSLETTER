				<p>In my Barangay, Brgy.Taberna, Christmas is always there, We all celebrate it with joy and happiness. Home made Parol and the Famous Carols are not fading. Barangay Taberna is one of the most populated barangay in Bauang but we're all families here. A truly Special place for Special People.</p>
				<br>
				<p>People in the Philippines like to celebrate Christmas for as long as possible! The playing of Christmas carols in shops can start in September! The formal Christmas celebrations start on 16th December when many people go the the first of nine pre-dawn or early morning masses. The last mass is on Christmas day. The Christmas celebrations continue to the First Sunday in January when Epiphany or the Feast of the Three Kings is celebrated.</p>

				<p>Every year, as Christmas approaches, houses arrange a dazzling display of colorful lights as well as putting their own
				Christmas trees. But what really is the meaning of celebrating Christmas, to christanity. Christmas is a very special celebration
			of the birth of Jesus Christ. A celebration that is filled with joy and excitement and also a season of forgiveness.</p>
